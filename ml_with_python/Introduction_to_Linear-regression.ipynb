    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable (independent variable, usually denoted as `x`), and the other is considered to be a dependent variable (usually denoted as `y`).\n",
