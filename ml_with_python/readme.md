Here is the flow of topics we will cover:

1. **Introduction to Regression**
    - Start with the basics of regression and understand its importance in predictive modeling.
    - Dive into **Simple Linear Regression** to learn how to model relationships between two variables.
    - Expand to **Multiple Linear Regression** for handling multiple predictors.
    - Explore **Regression Trees** as a non-linear approach to regression problems.

2. **Classification**
    - Learn the fundamentals of classification and its applications.
    - Study **Logistic Regression** for binary classification tasks.
    - Understand **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for instance-based learning.
    - Explore **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for robust classification boundaries.
    - Tackle **Multiclass Prediction** to handle problems with more than two classes.
    - Discover **Decision Trees** for interpretable classification models.

3. **Clustering**
    - Get introduced to unsupervised learning with **K-means Clustering** to find patterns in data.

4. **Final Project**
    - Apply all the concepts learned in a comprehensive final
